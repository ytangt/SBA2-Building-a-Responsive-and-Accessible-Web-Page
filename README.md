This project is a responsive, multi-section webpage built as part of a web design assignment.  
The site is designed for a **fictitious company** called **Dragonfly Arts Academy** and demonstrates semantic HTML, responsive layouts, and accessibility best practices.

## âœ¨ Features

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
- Uses `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for clear document structure.
- Headings are organized hierarchically (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`).

### 2. Responsive Design with Flexbox and Grid
- A **navigation bar** built with Flexbox that adapts to small screens.
- **Services section** uses CSS Grid.
- Media queries at **600px** (mobile) and **1024px** (tablet) adjust layout and font sizes.

### 3. Accessibility Features
- Navigation bar uses `role="navigation"` and `aria-label` attributes.
- All images include meaningful `alt` text.
- Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements and use `aria-describedby` for instructions.
- Color contrast checked with WebAIM to meet accessibility standards.

### 4. Visual Design
- Consistent color palette.
- Google Fonts: **Poppins** (body text) and **Knewave** (hero heading).
- Buttons and links styled with hover and focus states for better interaction feedback.
